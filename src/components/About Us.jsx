            <p className="section-subtitle reveal-left text-color">Our why</p>

            <p className="section-text reveal-left text-color">
              Every day, millions of vehicles operate across Africa transporting
              people and goods between cities and countries. This transportation
              ecosystem is powered by over 2 million neighborhood mom and pop
              retailers who provide $25B+ in parts annually to keep these
              vehicles running. With millions of these retailers struggling to
              get the right parts at the right price to serve customers, Garage
              bridges this gap by serving as a one stop wholesale parts
              marketplace, supporting retailers to get the parts they need to
              keep Africa's transportation engine operating.
